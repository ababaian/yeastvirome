\format{
A tibble with (at least) four columns:
\describe{
\item{display.order}{Integer sort key.}
\item{col.id}{Phenotype identifier.}
\item{experimental.group}{High-level category.}
\item{value.type}{Factor with levels \emph{numeric}, \emph{factor},
\emph{string}.}
}
Additional columns, if present in the source TSV, are retained as
character vectors so that no information is lost.
}
\usage{
phenome.layout
}
\description{
A tibble describing every phenotype measured in the 1,011-strain yeast
collection.  It is available immediately after \pkg{yeastvirome} is
attached, because it is populated at load-time by \code{.onLoad()}.
